# 🌦 Weather-Forecast-Real-Time-Analytics

## 📌 Overview
The **Real-Time Weather & Forecast Dashboard** is a Power BI project designed to visualize live weather conditions and forecasts across various cities in Kerala.
This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive view of current temperature, humidity, air quality, wind speed, and chances of rain, all updated in real-time using data fetched from the WeatherAPI.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI** → For building the interactive and dynamic dashboard.
- **WeatherAPI** → For fetching real-time weather and forecast data.
- **Power Query** → For API integration and data transformation.
 
## 🌐 Data Source
<a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/">WeatherAPI</a>
The API provides real-time and forecasted weather data, including temperature, pressure, humidity, and air quality indices.

## 🔑 Key Metrics
- **Temperature (°C)**: Current temperature across Kerala cities.
- **Humidity (%)**: Real-time humidity level.
- **Wind Speed (Kph)**: Average wind speed at current time.
- **Pressure (mm)**: Atmospheric pressure reading.
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Indicators for PM2.5, PM10, CO, O3, NO2, SO2.
- **Sunrise & Sunset Time**: Daily timing updates.
- **Chances of Rain (%)**: Forecast probability for the upcoming days.
  
## 📌 Features
- Displays current weather conditions for multiple Kerala cities.
- Real-time updates via live API connection.
- Forecast trends for upcoming days using line and bar charts.
- AQI indicator with color-coded categories (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy).
- Sunrise & Sunset visualization for daily reference.
- Clean and modern dark theme design with intuitive visuals.

## ⚙️ Process
1. The live weather data was fetched from WeatherAPI using a Power Query web connection.
2. Data transformation and structuring were done in Power Query Editor.
3. Key performance indicators (KPIs) and DAX measures were created to track and visualize metrics dynamically.
4. Multiple visuals (cards, gauges, and charts) were integrated for an aesthetic and informative layout.
5. The dashboard was optimized for real-time refresh and smooth interaction.

## 📈 Dashboard Insights
- **Temperature Trends**: Clear visualization of temperature variation across the week.
- **Air Quality Index**: Most Kerala regions show “Good” AQI, with occasional spikes in CO levels.
- **Rain Forecast**: Easy-to-read rain probability bars for better day planning.
- **User Experience**: The dark theme enhances visibility and creates a premium dashboard appearance.
